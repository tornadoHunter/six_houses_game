===============

This is a little game for me to understand the basic synax and principles of python. 

An idea for a game in python to play around with its string processing capabilities 
and associative psychology. 

I used widely accepted psychological associations in the game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What might happen with the project if I will not be a lazy ass: 

1)Learning enough python to make simple pictures and graphics. 

2)Maybe use python comic engine to make an interactive comic book with about 12 pages. 

3)Or better yet to learn some python 2D game engine to make a little game.
